infoPill=What have you done? Don’t throw medicines in the biowaste, return them to the pharmacy!
infoBerry=Ripe strawberries are delicious. However, if you find a spoiled strawberry among the ripe ones, it can be put in the biowaste.
infoBattery1=Oh no, batteries don’t belong in the compost at all! The liquid leaking from the broken batteries is toxic and corrosive.
infoBattery2=Could you stop bringing batteries in here? Take them back to the store you purchased them from or to a designated collection point.
infoPoop1=It smells strange in here, could you please use the toilet next time? Feces in the biowaste is a health risk.
infoPoop2=Horrible, dog poop in the compost can cause a worm infection in the soil user. Dog poop belongs to the mixed waste.

info2=Phosphorus reserves necessary for food production are dwindling. By composting biowaste we can recover that vital element.

info4=Well done, by composting we can recover the phosphorus necessary for food production!
info5=Awesome, we can make these into biogas, which can be used to even drive a car!
info6=Fantastic, keep up the good work so I can plant my flowerbed full of flowers!
info7=You collected biowaste well! Now the biowaste you collected will be crushed, mixed and composted. Compost can then be used as a soil in a flower bed to return nutrients to nature.
info8=Great, this garbage makes wonderful bio mold when composted!
info9=Biowaste is an easy source of fertilizers and it doesn’t consume natural resources.
info10=Absolute win!
info11=Awesome! Composting biowaste reduces methane emissions and recovers importants nutrients.
info12=The important nutrients contained in the biowaste can be recovered by composting.
